### 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I hold a University Degree in Computer Science and I am currently pursuing a Systems Engineering degree.  
I consider myself a self-taught person, eager to learn, whether through university courses, personal projects, or self-study.  
I enjoy working in teams, collaborating with others, and also advancing independently when the project requires it.  
I am seeking job opportunities that allow me to keep growing in the software development field.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 🐾 APV - Veterinarian Patient Appointment Manager  
📎 [Live Demo & Repository](https://github.com/LucreciaVeron/apv_frontend_deploy)

A **Fullstack MERN** application for managing veterinary clinic patients. It allows veterinarians to register, log in, confirm accounts via email, and manage patient information.

**Key Features:**
- **Authentication**: JWT-based registration, login, and password recovery (Nodemailer + Mailtrap).
- **Profile Management**: Edit personal info, update password, and add optional details.
- **Patient Management**: Register, edit, and delete patient info (name, owner, symptoms, etc.).
- **Navigation**: Easy access to patient list, profile, and logout.

This project demonstrates my skills in building secure, full-stack applications with MERN.

#### 🐦 Vegan Flappy Bird
📎 [View Repository](https://github.com/LucreciaVeron/Vegan-Flappy-Bird)

A replica of the classic Flappy Bird game developed in **Java** using object-oriented programming principles, with an educational and sustainable twist:

- The bird gains points by eating **vegetables** and loses points when eating **meat**.
- The bird can also turn meat into vegetables during gameplay!
- It includes custom logic and graphic animations.

> This project demonstrates my ability to recreate well-known games, add extra logic, and apply good OOP practices.

### 📚 What I've Learned

I recently completed an intensive Modern JavaScript course where I learned everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming with **Classes** and **Prototypes**
- Asynchronous programming with **Promises**, **Async/Await**, and handling **Fetch API**
- Consuming **REST APIs** with JSON
- Applying **Higher Order Functions**, **Arrow Functions**, **Generators**, **Template Literals**
- Testing with **Cypress**, **Jest**, and developing custom frameworks

🛠️ I also worked on practical projects such as:

- CRM with **IndexedDB**
- Insurance and loan calculators
- Simulators with **LocalStorage** storage
- Full-stack apps with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **Sequelize**, and **React**
- Interactive sites like search engines, calendars, calculators, and shopping carts

> This course helped me solidify my skills as a full-stack developer with a focus on Modern JavaScript (MERN, Vue, etc.).
